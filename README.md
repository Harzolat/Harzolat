- ⚡ Fun fact: ...Did you know that the term "debugging" comes from an incident where Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth inside a computer and removed it, thus "debugging" the system? This incident led to the popularization of the term "debugging" to describe the process of fixing computer errors or defects.
